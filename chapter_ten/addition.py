"""
One common problem when prompting for numerical input occurs when people provide text instead of numbers.
When you try to convert the input to an int, youâ€™ll get a ValueError.
Write a program that prompts for two numbers. Add them together and print the result.
Catch the ValueError if either input value is not a number, and print a friendly error message.
Test your program by entering two numbers and then by entering some text instead of a number.
