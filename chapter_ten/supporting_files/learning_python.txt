You’ll learn to handle errors so your programs don’t crash when they encounter unexpected situations.
You’ll learn about exceptions, which are special objects Python creates to manage errors that arise
while a program is running.
You’ll also learn about the json module, which allows you to save user data so it isn’t lost when
your program stops running.
Learning to work with files and save data will make your programs easier for people to use.
Users will be able to choose what data to enter and when to enter it.
People can run your program, do some work, and then close the program and pick up where they left off later.
Learning to handle exceptions will help you deal with situations in which files don’t exist and deal with
other problems that can cause your programs to crash.
